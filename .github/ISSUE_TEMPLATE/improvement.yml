        Based on your answer, the Doctocat who triages this issue will do one of the following:

        • Review your issue and confirm the changes listed here cover all affected areas of the docs. Then, they'll invite you to open a PR and give you guidance on how to do so! This is the quickest way to get things changed.
        • Triage to our backlog. We'll get to it as soon as we can.
        • Close this issue as something we're unable to prioritize right now. Sometimes, we just can't prioritize changes, but if we make sweeping updates to this area of the docs, we'll scan through old issues if possible.
      placeholder: Mention the handle of the person who will open the PR, please include your buddies handle if you are volunteering to work on this.
